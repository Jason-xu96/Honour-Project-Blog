          <h5>Nov 6, 2019</h5>
          <p>
            1. Compile Tekkotsu behaviour program
            <br>
            After installing Tekkotsu's dependencies. I started to build a simple program following the instructions on http://www.tekkotsu.org/execution.html
            <br>
            I encoutered an error saying "cc1plus: error: unrecognized command line option '-std=c++11'",
            and it turned out that the gcc installed from the tutorial http://www.tekkotsu.org/openr-install.html was too old for the latest version of Tekkotsu.
            <br>
            I realized that the two Tekkotsu setup tutorials on the same website are for two different version of Tekkotsu although it was not explicitly mentioned.
            <br>
            I downgraded my Tekkotsu version to 4.0.1. And the program was successfully compiled.
            <br>
            2. Install Mirage (Mirage is a simulation environment which can host multiple agents in a virtual world.)
            <br>
            The OPEN-R SDK I installed comes with GCC 3.3.6. It only works with Tekkotsu 4.0.1 which doesn't include Mirage in its source code.
            <br>
            Fortunately, I found a package called AIBO+ that builds a new AI of AIBO from scratch. It comes with OPEN-R SDK with GCC 5.4. It could potentially work with Tekkotsu 5.1 which does include Mirage.
            <br>
            When I tried to install, it said "E: Unable to locate package". Then I tried to extract OPEN_R_SDK from the source code and compile Tekkotusu program,
            but it was not successful

          <h2>Bi-Weekly Update</h2>
          <h5>Oct 23, 2019</h5>
          <p>
            <br>
            1. Continued look into what the best way is to install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
            <br>
            I could install Ubuntu on a 16GB flash drive. That gives me enough room for now so that I should be able to continue with my framework setup.
            <br>
            Dr. Jim emailed me back saying he would recommend use a virtual machine.
            <br>
            I installed Ubuntu in VirtualBox.
            <br>
            2. Familiarized myself with Linux commands.
            <br>
            Learned how to edit text files with vim, how to run programs with the security privileges.
            <br>
            3. Start to set up Tekkotsu and its dependencies.
            <br>
            Downloaded and installed the latest version of Tekkotsu using CVS (Concurrent Versions System).
            <br>
            Installed Open-R SDK as a dependency of Tekkotsu. One of its dependency 'texinfo' was too new. I had to downgrade it.
            <br>
            4.Since I don't have a physical robot to run the Tekkotsu program on, I also try to set up Mirage which is a virtual environment for hosting agents and its dependency.
            <br>
            Some links to the dependencies of it are invalid since the framework hasn't been updated since 2010
            <br>
            5.Start to create a tutorial for how to set up Tekkotsu.
            <br>
            Dr. Jim recommended this because it allows me to document what I have done in detail.
            Also since the framework hasn't been updated for ten years, a tutorial will help people set up the framework with ease in the future.

          <h5>Oct 12, 2019</h5>
          <p>
            1. Looked into the old AIBO Programming Framework "Tekkotsu" at http://www.tekkotsu.org/ArchitecturalOverview.html
            <br>
            Familiarized myself with its high-level architecture, user interface, and syntax.
            <br>
            2. Master student Rahatul Amin who work with me on this project sent an inquiry about the API release to Sony Japan.
            <br>
            Sony responded that its open API is scheduled to be released in November 2019.
            <br>
            3. Found out that the existing tool My Aibo app could potentially give us some control over Aibo.
            <br>
            Asked for the particular account associated with the robot in order to log in. Explored what we can do with the app.
            Functions like viewing photo taken by Aibo and patroling could be relevant to our study.
            <br>
            4. Start to set up the programming environment for running Tekkotsu
            <br>
            Installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS following the instructions at http://wiki.tekkotsu.org/index.php/Install_instructions
            <br>
            Found out my computer doesn't have enough space for installing an operating system alongside Windows 10.
            (After I installed it, there's only 600 MB allocated for the system.) I told Dr. Young about it and he has asked Jeff Durston if we could get a computer from school.
            <br>
            Troubleshot network connection issue and solved it by blacklisting acer_wmi

          <h5>Sep 25, 2019</h5>
          <p>
            1. Went through AIBO Programming Tutorial at http://aibostuff.iofreak.com/wiki.php?n=Aibo.Development
            <br>
            Familiarized myself with R-CODE syntax and some sample programs.
            <br>
            2. Found out that Sony postponed its open API release to Fall 2019 according to https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000044.000024857.html
            <br>
            Dr. Jim Young is reaching out to his connections to find out when exactly the open API will be released.
            <br>
            3. Was recommended by Dr. JIm Young to look into a programming framework called "Tekkotsu".
            <br>
            Started to look into its manual at http://www.tekkotsu.org/about.html
            <br>
            4. Found that the pink memory stick is on sale at https://www.ebay.ca/itm/Rare-SONY-16MB-Memory-Stick-AIBO-ERA-MS016-NEW-SEALED/383107582403?hash=item5932fdc9c3:g:-nUAAOSwjW5dV4-x
            <br>
            The pink memory stick is required for programming the old Aibo. Already messaged Dr. Young about it.

          <h2>Weekly Update</h2>
          <h5>Sep 17, 2019</h5>
          <p>
            1. Found out that Sony was supposed to release its open API for the latest Aibo ERS-1000 in August according to https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/home-robots/sony-upgrading-aibo-with-new-home-security-features-api-access
            <br>
            But there isn't any API released by Sony as of Sep 17, 2019, so Dr. Young suggested to program the old Aibo ERS-7 first.
            <br>
            I also sent an email to Sony regarding when the API will come out, and haven't got a response yet.
            <br>
            2. Went through AIBO Programming Tutorial at https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~tucker/courses/amrs/aibo/AIBOProgrammingTutorial.pdf
            <br>
            Learned about OPENR objects and their communication mechanism
            <br>
            3. Read the general overview of the Aibo software development environment on Aibo wikipedia page at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIBO#Software
            <br>
            Found out that the three main ways of programming Aibo are: OPEN-R SDK, R-CODE, and AIBO remote framework.
            <br>
            4. Compared different software development environments from http://aibostuff.iofreak.com/wiki.php?n=Aibo.Development
            <br>
            Started look into R-CODE syntax since it is high-level and easy to grasp.

                Aibo’s behaviours to convey its states and intentions
                <br>

            </h4>
            <h4>I. Abstract:</h4>
            Robots come in all shapes and sizes. Some scientists draw their inspiration from animals. Unlike
            their humanoid counterparts, animal-inspired robots are not expected to speak human languages,
            so how they communicate with humans becomes a challenge. This project looks into a robot dog
            Aibo. By examining how humans perceive and react to its certain movements, we could find out
            the most effective behaviours to convey its states and intentions.
            <h4>II. Introduction to the topic:</h4>
            There are still lots of unknowns when it comes to the most effective, universal behaviours for an
            animal robot to communicate with humans. Many motions could be interpreted differently
            depending on a user’s cultural background. Various research papers from the HCI lab at
            University of Manitoba have looked into this issue.
            <h4>III. Your background preparation to do this project:</h4>
            I completed HCI I, II, and Graphic I, which give me a solid understanding of how humans
            perceive and interact with computing technology.
            My previous summer research term immersed me in a research environment and equipped me
            with better problem-solving skills.

            Flying Robot by Megha Sharma.
            <h4>V. Problem Statement:</h4>
            Evaluate the feasibility of running formal experiments on what
            behaviours are the most effective in communicating an Aibo’s intentions and states to its user.
            <h4>VI. Methodology:</h4>
            Timeboxing helps break down the schedule into timeboxes with each timebox having its own deliverables.
